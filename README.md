# PhraseGenerator

A project I made because I was struggling for ideas for games so I though of an idea to help me come up with ideas, a phrase generator.
The Phrase Generator takes a large collection of words (~3000) and spits out random words from that list, the amount of words in a phrase is dependent on how many the user wants. The user can also click on a generated phrase and it will be added to the favorites list on the right.
